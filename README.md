# BurgerJoint

Burgerjoint is a fictional burger restaurant website that showcases tons of unique menu itmes and allows a user to place either a pick up or delivery order. I was inspired to build this after stumbling upon a bunch of burgers images online, and decided to practice my flex-box and form-validation skills.
